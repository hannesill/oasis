institutions that are part of developing processes

and the communities which are part of these programmes

Our programmes take place in Ghana, a country that faces numerous challenges to its development: lack of or inadequate access to water and sanitation, poor infrastructures, low enrolment rates in secondary and tertiary educational institutions, high maternal/child mortality rates.

However, Ghana is also host to a large talented young population/ workforce, is rich in resources, has one of the highest GDP growth figures in all of Africa, and is destination for increasing numbers of investors/tourism.

Civil society organisations are key to fair and inclusive development processes; globalisation processes tend to target economic rather than social growth or wellbeing; this sows the path towards increasing inequalities within populations.

Sustainable development thus should tackle growth across board: all sectors of society, in both rural and urban spaces. It must do so respecting local culture, the environment, and trying to ensure future generations' needs are protected today. 

Our contribution to this is to provide or assist those already providing services in the areas of Education, Health and Water and Sanitation, using a participatory approach -working alongside local rural populations, in locally relevant projects.",,,,,,,35db27c1-3a1a-44cc-a3ab-714fc77d451c,"['generalSurgery', 'infectiousDiseases']",['SVG Africa conducted surgeries during a health mission in the Kwahu Districts in March 2016.'],[],"['SVG Africa conducts health missions in local hospitals and communities in Ghana.', 'SVG Africa partnered with The Helen Hodgkins Trust in January 2016 to initiate water and sanitation projects.', 'SVG Africa collaborated with the Ghana AIDS Commission for an HIV/AIDS prevention and awareness campaign in Easter 2013.', 'SVG Africa distributed 20 community water filters in July/August 2014, reaching about 4,000 people.', 'SVG Africa completed the construction of a toilet block for a large school in Aduamoah in August 2015.']",,SVG Africa,,,flagged,APPROXIMATE
