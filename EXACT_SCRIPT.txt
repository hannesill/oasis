OASIS ARCHITECTURE VIDEO — EXACT SCRIPT
========================================

[0:00-0:10] USER LAYER
----------------------
It starts with a user asking a question in natural language: "Where are the surgical deserts in Northern Ghana?" The question flows to Claude Desktop's MCP Client, where Anthropic Claude performs agent reasoning. The result? An interactive 3D map visualization appears right here in Claude Desktop.

[0:10-0:22] ORCHESTRATION LAYER
--------------------------------
Behind the scenes, the MCP Protocol connects Claude to our OASIS orchestration server. OASIS is the brain — it manages three critical registries: the Tool Registry routes to our geospatial and data tools, the Dataset Registry handles our 1,002 Ghana healthcare facilities, and the MCP Apps Protocol launches interactive visualizations like our map.

[0:22-0:40] SERVICES LAYER
--------------------------
OASIS orchestrates three service layers. First, Geospatial Tools — five functions that find facilities in radius, detect coverage gaps, calculate distances, geocode locations to latitude and longitude, and count facilities. Second, our Geomap Application — powered by Mapbox GL JS for real-time rendering, Three.js for 3D models, creating medical desert heatmaps that visualize gaps in real-time. Third, Databricks Integration — Genie converts natural language to SQL queries, MLflow traces every tool call for citation transparency, and RAG semantic search finds facilities by meaning, not keywords.

[0:40-0:55] DATA LAYER
----------------------
All services connect to our data foundation. DuckDB Local Analytics stores our VF Ghana Parquet dataset — 1,002 healthcare facilities ready for fast SQL queries. Data Sanity & Anomalies uses Google Geocoding API for precise coordinates, performs column harmonization, and generates anomaly risk summaries to flag data inconsistencies. And our Embeddings Cache stores semantic vectors using both databricks-bge-large-en and all-MiniLM-L6-v2 models, enabling RAG search that understands meaning, not just keywords.

[0:55-1:00] FULL FLOW
---------------------
One question flows through all four layers — from natural language to orchestration, through specialized services, powered by rich data. That's OASIS: Orchestrated Agentic System for Intelligent Healthcare Synthesis. Bridging medical deserts, one conversation at a time.
